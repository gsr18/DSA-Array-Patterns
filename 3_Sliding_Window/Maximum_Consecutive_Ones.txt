ðŸ”¸ Example 1: Maximum Consecutive Ones

--> Key Idea: Count longest stretch of 1s using a window that resets on 0

Why Sliding Window?
We're finding the longest substring of 1sâ€”strictly forward movement

--> Approach:
Expand end, reset start on 0, track max length

--> Visualisation

[1,1,0,1,1,1,0,1]
 ---- length=2, reset â†’ then length=3 ...


--> Pseudocode

start = 0, maxLen = 0
for end = 0 to n-1:
  if arr[end] == 0: start = end + 1
  maxLen = max(maxLen, end - start + 1)
