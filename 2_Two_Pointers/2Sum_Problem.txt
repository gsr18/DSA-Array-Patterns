ðŸ”¸ Example 4: Two Sum (Sorted Array)

--> Key Idea: Use a left and right pointer to home in on the target sum, adjusting based on whether current sum is too large or too small.

Why Two Pointers?
Sorted array lets us adjust based on sum comparison.

--> Approach:

i = 0, j = n-1
If arr[i] + arr[j] > target, decrement j; if less, increment i

--> Visualisation

 i â†’       <- j
[1, 2, 4, 7, 11]
 1+11=12 > target â†’ j--
...
Found 4+7=11


--> Pseudocode

i = 0, j = n-1
while i < j:
    sum = arr[i] + arr[j]
    if sum == target: return [i, j]
    if sum < target: i++
    else: j--
