🔸 Example 2: Remove Duplicates in Sorted Array

--> Key Idea: Keep only one copy of each number by keeping a “write” pointer while scanning, minimizing overwrites.

Why Two Pointers?
One pointer for last unique (i), one for scanning (j).

--> Approach:

If arr[j] != arr[i], increment i, copy arr[j] → arr[i]
Return i + 1 as new length

--> Visualisation

 i     j
[1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
     ↑
Found 2 != 1
Write at i+1:
[1, 2, _, _, _]
......

--> Pseudocode

i = 0
for j = 1 to n-1:
    if arr[j] != arr[i]:
        i++
        arr[i] = arr[j]
return i + 1
