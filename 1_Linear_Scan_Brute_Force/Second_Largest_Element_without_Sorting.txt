2. Find Second Largest (No Sorting)

ðŸ”‘ Key Idea: Track two variables â€” first_max and second_max


--> PseudoCode 

first = second = -âˆž
for num in arr:
    if num > first:
        second = first
        first = num
    else if num > second and num != first:
        second = num


Time: O(n)

Space: O(1)
