ðŸ”¸ Leaders in an Array

--> Key Idea: An element greater than all to its right gets printed

Why?
Greedy scan from right, track max

--> Approach:
Traverse from right â†’ if arr[i] > maxRight, record it

--> Visualisation

[16,17,4,3,5,2]
          â†‘
2 â†’ max=2 â†’ keep
    5>2 â†’ keep / update
    3<5 â†’ skip
    ...


--> Pseudocode

maxFromRight = -âˆž
for i=n-1 down to 0:
  if arr[i] > maxFromRight:
    print arr[i]
    maxFromRight = arr[i]
