ðŸ”¸ Sort 0s, 1s, 2s (Dutch National Flag)

--> Key Idea: Place 0s, 1s, and 2s in order using three-way partition

Why Sorting + Greedy?
You can do it in one pass with pointer logic

--> Approach:
Initialize low, mid, and high. Swap mid with low/high based on value 0/2.

--> Visualisation

low mid      high
[2,0,1,2,0,1]
 swap-and-advance  
 Partition into sorted blocks


--> Pseudocode

low=0, mid=0, high=n-1
while mid<=high:
  if arr[mid]==0: swap(arr[low++],arr[mid++])
  else if arr[mid]==1: mid++
  else: swap(arr[mid], arr[high--])
