ðŸ”¸ Merge Overlapping Intervals

--> Key Idea: Combine any overlapping time ranges

Why?
Sorting by start time makes greedy merging easy

--> Approach:
Sort by start, then merge if current.start <= last.end

--> Visualisation

[1,3],[2,6] overlap â†’ becomes [1,6]
[8,10],[9,12] overlap â†’ [8,12]


--> Pseudocode

sort intervals by start
res.push(intervals[0])
for each interval:
  if interval.start<=res.back().end:
    res.back().end=max(res.back().end, interval.end)
  else:
    res.push(interval)
